        "content": "It should be noted that I am not a legal expert. The following seems to be the case:\n- Police are now allowed to enter your phone for less severe crimes \n- Individual EU members have to implement this in their own legal codex. E.g.: this is just a statement that it is *not* against EU rules to do so\n\n## Forced opening\n- In **Belgium**, [cops are allowed to force you to give your code. Good luck! (Dutch/Belgian news site (Tweakers))](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/163116/belgische-rechter-verdachte-mag-verplicht-worden-code-smartphone-af-te-staan.html)\n- In the **Netherlands**, [cops are allowed to forcibly use open your phone using biometrics (Dutch/Belgian news site (Tweakers))](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/177886/hoge-raad-politie-mag-telefoon-onder-dwang-ontgrendelen-met-vingerafdruk.html)\n\n## What now?\n### Safe biometric locking\nSo, as long as the Netherlands doesn't implement rulings similar Belgium's; how can you protect yourself?\n\n- **iOS:** Hold the power/side button and either volume button for 2 seconds. Next time you try to unlock your phone, it will ask for your PIN code before allowing biometric unlock. This works when the phone is locked and unlocked\n- **Google Pixel:** Hold the power & volume up button until a menu appears. Select Lockdown from there. See [9to5google's Google Pixel lockdown article](https://9to5google.com/2022/03/08/how-to-enable-lockdown-mode-on-pixel/)\n- Many phones have their own implementation. Look up \"disabling biometric unlock\", \"lockdown mode\" or \"hard lock\" with your phone manufacturer & model.\n\n## Sources\n- [Official document (PDF, curia.europa.eu)](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-10/cp240171en.pdf)\n- [Dutch/Belgian news article (tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/227336/europees-hof-van-justitie-politie-mag-telefoon-doorzoeken-bij-kleine-misdrijven.html)"
