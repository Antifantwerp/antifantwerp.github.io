        "content": "## Should my footage be blurred?\nUnless you have great reason to not (e.g. consent from whoever is unblurred), yes.\n- Recognisable individuals can be in abusive/unsafe situations where mere proof of attendance could get them in trouble or danger\n- Cops explicitly need to be blurred in [the Netherlands (PDF, politie.nl)](https://www.politie.nl/binaries/content/assets/politie/onderwerpen/social-media/instructie-beeld-op-social-media.pdf), and are [recommended to be blurred in Belgium (policewatch.be)](https://policewatch.be/pagina/eerste_reflexen)\n\n\n## Deface\nThe following guide uses a tool called [deface (github.com)](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface). This allows you to **blur images and videos** *locally* with one command.\n\n> Note that this will obviously not look as good as manual blurring in video editing, but it is a good quick and dirty way to get it done.\n\nAs of writing, using deface requires some knowledge of how to use a **command line**. This does mean it supports **Linux**, **MacOS** & **Windows**.\n\n### Installation & usage\n1. Install any version of [Python 3 (python.org)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system. If asked, add Python to PATH.\n2. Open a command line and run `python3 -m pip install deface`\n    *(Note: you might have to use `python` instead of `python3`)*\n3. After this is done, navigate your command line to the image/video file\n4. Run `deface yourfilename.mp4 --keep-audio --thresh 0.2 --mask-scale 1.2` *(note: remove `--keep-audio` when blurring images)*\n\nDone! It will run (for a while, for videos) and then put the blurred file next to the original. If the result doesn't look right, change the number values and run deface again. See `deface -h` and the [deface README (github.com)](https://github.com/ORB-HD/deface) for all possible options.\n\n> Nix users can use the [deface package (search.nixos.org)](https://search.nixos.org/packages?show=defacetype=packages&query=deface) instead of step 1 and 2.\n\n#### Windows batch script\nIf you're on Windows, here's an example script that you can drag a file onto from your file explorer.\n```batch\ndeface %1 --keep-audio --thresh 0.1 --mask-scale 1.2\n```"

        "content": "It should be noted that I am not a legal expert. The following seems to be the current new situation:\n- The European Union Court of Justice ruled that police are now **allowed to enter your phone for non-severe crimes**\n- Individual EU countries have to implement this in their own legal codex. E.g.: this is just a statement that it is *not* against EU rules to do so\n\nSee the [official document (PDF, curia.europa.eu)](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-10/cp240171en.pdf) and a [Dutch/Belgian news article on the court decision (NL, tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/227336/europees-hof-van-justitie-politie-mag-telefoon-doorzoeken-bij-kleine-misdrijven.html).\n\n## Forced opening\n- In **Belgium**, cops are allowed to force you to give your code. Good luck! See [Belgian Judge rules that suspects may be forced to give up their smartphone code (NL, tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/163116/belgische-rechter-verdachte-mag-verplicht-worden-code-smartphone-af-te-staan.html)\n- In the **Netherlands**, cops are allowed to forcibly open your phone using biometrics. See [high counsel: police may unlock phone forcibly with fingerprint (NL, tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/177886/hoge-raad-politie-mag-telefoon-onder-dwang-ontgrendelen-met-vingerafdruk.html)\n\n## What now?\n### Remote wiping\n- iOS: use Find Devices - [Erase a device in Find Devices on iCloud.com (support.apple.com)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfc0ef36f/icloud)\n- Android: enable Find My Device - [Find, secure, or erase a device remotely (support.google.com)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491)\n- Non-Google Android: install FindMyDevice - [FindMyDevice app (f-froid)](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.nulide.findmydevice/) & [FindMyDevice repo (gitlab.com)](https://gitlab.com/Nulide/findmydevice)\n\n> Make sure to backup your authenticator apps & any data you want to keep before doing this\n\n### Safe biometric locking\nSo, as long as the Netherlands doesn't implement rulings similar Belgium's; how can you protect yourself?\n\n- **iOS:** Hold the power/side button and either volume button for 2 seconds. Next time you try to unlock your phone, it will ask for your PIN code before allowing biometric unlock. This works when the phone is locked and unlocked\n- **Google Pixel:** Hold the power & volume up button until a menu appears. Select Lockdown from there. See [9to5google's Google Pixel lockdown article](https://9to5google.com/2022/03/08/how-to-enable-lockdown-mode-on-pixel/)\n- Many phones have their own implementation. Look up \"disabling biometric unlock\", \"lockdown mode\" or \"hard lock\" with your phone manufacturer & model.\n"

He noted that **false positives were common**, and **random/small variations** can be the **difference between a high/low score**\n  - FTM asked 4 scientists from Radboud University (with expertise in computer sciences, algorithms or the legal system) to review the findings. They concluded it was a **limited algorithm that can have risky consequences**. Djoerd Hiemstra (professor data sciences) **compared it to a dice roll**\n  - Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius high teacher ICT & law, mentions that **only written-up/recorded** crime is weighted; and as such it can **not represent the entirety of crime**, whilst still being **heavily influenced** by **past police's actions/decisions on specific types of minors**\n  - **Internal investigation** by ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid (ministry of justice & safety) also concluded the **algorithm is lacking**\n  - Previous attempts to do familiar things that never worked:\n    - 2022: Algemene Rekenkamer concluded the Criminaliteit Anticipatie Systeem **lacked even basic requirements**\n    - 2013-: [A politico article about the \"**ruined thousands of lives**\" of the **Dutch anti-fraud algorithm** (EN, politico.eu)](https://www.politico.eu/article/dutch-scandal-serves-as-a-warning-for-europe-over-risks-of-using-algorithms/)\n    - 2015-2023: [An Erasmus University Rotterdam article reporting on the Police **no longer using the violence prediction algorithm** after it turned out to not be useful, and **even automatically assigning high scores** to people of **Moroccan, Somalian and Antillean origins** (NL, eur.nl)](https://www.eur.nl/nieuws/politie-stopt-met-algoritme-dat-voorspelt-wie-de-toekomst-geweld-gaat-gebruiken)\n\n**Authors note:** I use the word \"minors\" above, but the affected people do still include 18 year olds. However, this age seems to be the **upper limit**, and these people are often still  in **high school**. That aside, the **largest percentage** of people affected are full on **minors**. While \"youth\" might work as a replacement for \"minors\" for some, it is not used both due to its association with adolescence and to avoid understating the severity of this situation."
