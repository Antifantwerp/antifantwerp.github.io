        "title": "EU court of justice allows cops to look into phones for small crimes",
        "description": "About cops & phone access. This decision has been made over 85 grams of weed.",
        "content": "It should be noted that I am not a legal expert. The following seems to be the current new situation:\n- The European Union Court of Justice ruled that police are now **allowed to enter your phone for non-severe crimes**\n- Individual EU countries have to implement this in their own legal codex. E.g.: this is just a statement that it is *not* against EU rules to do so\n\nSee the [official document (PDF, curia.europa.eu)](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2024-10/cp240171en.pdf) and a [Dutch/Belgian news article on the court decision (NL, tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/227336/europees-hof-van-justitie-politie-mag-telefoon-doorzoeken-bij-kleine-misdrijven.html).\n\n## Forced opening\n- In **Belgium**, cops are allowed to force you to give your code. Good luck! See [Belgian Judge rules that suspects may be forced to give up their smartphone code (NL, tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/163116/belgische-rechter-verdachte-mag-verplicht-worden-code-smartphone-af-te-staan.html)\n- In the **Netherlands**, cops are allowed to forcibly open your phone using biometrics. See [high counsel: police may unlock phone forcibly with fingerprint (NL, tweakers.net)](https://tweakers.net/nieuws/177886/hoge-raad-politie-mag-telefoon-onder-dwang-ontgrendelen-met-vingerafdruk.html)\n\n## What now?\n### Remote wiping\n- iOS: use Find Devices - [Erase a device in Find Devices on iCloud.com (support.apple.com)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfc0ef36f/icloud)\n- Android: enable Find My Device - [Find, secure, or erase a device remotely (support.google.com)](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491)\n- Non-Google Android: install FindMyDevice - [FindMyDevice app (f-froid)](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.nulide.findmydevice/) & [FindMyDevice repo (gitlab.com)](https://gitlab.com/Nulide/findmydevice)\n\n> Make sure to backup your authenticator apps & any data you want to keep before doing this\n\n### Safe biometric locking\nSo, as long as the Netherlands doesn't implement rulings similar Belgium's; how can you protect yourself?\n\n- **iOS:** Hold the power/side button and either volume button for 2 seconds. Next time you try to unlock your phone, it will ask for your PIN code before allowing biometric unlock. This works when the phone is locked and unlocked\n- **Google Pixel:** Hold the power & volume up button until a menu appears. Select Lockdown from there. See [9to5google's Google Pixel lockdown article](https://9to5google.com/2022/03/08/how-to-enable-lockdown-mode-on-pixel/)\n- Many phones have their own implementation. Look up \"disabling biometric unlock\", \"lockdown mode\" or \"hard lock\" with your phone manufacturer & model.\n"
