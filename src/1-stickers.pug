    h2#howto How-to: covering/removing stickers
    :markdown-it
        ### Safety
        Content warning for bodily injury: if so, skip to the next header with the takeaway "cover, don't remove".

        Keep in mind that some far-right people have been shown to attempt to stop by putting razor blades under their stickers.
        This means that, when faced with a sticker you wish removed.

        - Use a tool to remove it 
        - Cover it up with another stickers
        - Or - if you are adept at tactile detection - check if the sticker is hiding something underneath 
                

        Let my stance be clear: do NOT do this. And that isn't a bid for respectability politics.
        This is because this assumes that a far-right person will remove it.
        So remember: the chance that an innocent government worker, volunteer, store employee,
        or random person might be tasked with removing the sticker is not impossible.
        Hurting innocent people is a price not worth paying.
