# Stickers 
Information about stickering from both sides.

## Covering/removing stickers
### Safety
Content warning for bodily injury: if so, skip to the next header with the takeaway "cover, don't remove".

Keep in mind that some far-right people have been shown to attempt to stop by putting razor blades under their stickers.
This means that, when faced with a sticker you wish removed.

- Use a tool to remove it 
- Cover it up with another stickers
- Or - if you are adept at tactile detection - check if the sticker is hiding something underneath 
        

Let my stance be clear: do NOT do this. And that isn't a bid for respectability politics.
This is because this assumes that a far-right person will remove it.
So remember: the chance that an innocent government worker, volunteer, store employee,
or random person might be tasked with removing the sticker is not impossible.
Hurting innocent people is a price not worth paying.
